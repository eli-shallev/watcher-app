## Description
I decided to build a simple CRUDL app based on react classes in order to practice the use of classes in react because most of my react apps use mostly functions. I want to keep expanding my knowladge and try new chalanges. That was **my motivation.** 

And a bit about the project - a small App that was built in a few days, showing a streaming service users menu with basic crudl of users.
